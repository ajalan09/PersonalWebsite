          <h2>About</h2>
          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m an aspiring tech entrepreneur, currently studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Although I’m currently studying in the United States, I hail from India and have lived in Dubai for most of my life. I received my IB Diploma at Dubai International Academy, where I was actively involved in Model UN as the Deputy Secretary General and was the President of a volunteering organization called DIA Cares. However, I’m most proud of founding Business Minds, an accelerator for student startups. At university, I’m part of a fraternity (Sigma Beta Rho) and am actively involved in the South Asian community. Over the past summer, I worked on my technical skills in a broad range of topics such as iOS App Development, Machine Learning and Web Development. With these skills, I brought two big projects to fruition, Progressify and ChanceMe@UMich. I further plan on leveraging these skills at <a href="https://productiv.com/"> Productiv</a>, a tech startup based in Silicon Valley, where I’ll be working as a Software Engineering Intern this upcoming summer! In my free time, I really enjoy adventure sports such as skydiving, bungee jumping and scuba-diving. A fun fact about me is that I skydived in Switzerland when I was just 9 years old! I’m hoping to pursue a skydiving license, so I can go on solo jumps!

              <p class="experience-box description-text"> I was the Founder of Business Minds, an accelerator for student startups in the Dubai. In the first edition of the event, of which I was President, we saw over 50 startups pitch their ideas to
                judges working at companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. We were sponsored by the Apparel Group, receiving over $5000 in sponsorships, which was used as prize money for the winners of the event. The subsequent editions of
                the event have grown exponentially, seeing a 2x rise in sponsorship money and participants. We were also featured on Gulf News, the national news outlet of the UAE.

              <p class="experience-box description-text"> I was a Tech Consultant at MEG Consulting, where I worked on a project with a company on campus to help them streamline their on-boarding process for employees. I performed market research on
                competing software and integrated components from those into the client’s software. I also helped reorganize over 800 training files into enhanced modules, enhancing user accessibility. Lastly, to improve the UI design, I implemented
                a progress bar using HTML. The software was piloted on over 100 employees, receiving a 90%+ satisfaction rate.

              <p class="experience-box description-text"> I personally went through a body transformation, where I lost over 50 pounds. During my journey, I used pictures to track my progress. After researching different weight-tracking apps on the
                market, I found out that none of the currently-available weight management apps had a feature to store and compare transformation pictures. This motivated me to build Progressify, an iOS app that enables the user to track his fitness
                progress not only through his weight, but also through his transformation pictures. I used tools such as Sketch and SwiftUI to design and build the app. The app is currently being beta-tested, and will soon be released on the App
                Store!

              <p class="experience-box description-text"> With increasingly competitive applications, current college admissions criteria are hard to define. ChanceMe@UMich aims to predict a student's chances into the University of Michigan using
                Machine Learning based on various factors such as academics, extracurricular activities, and demographics. Through an interactive web application, prospective students will be able to gauge where they stand in comparison to previously
                accepted applicants. I collected the dataset first-hand by surveying college students across the United States and received 1000+ entries. Using a simple logistic regression model in Scikit-Learn, I was able to predict a student’s
                likelihood of admissions with a 70% accuracy. Tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn were used. The interactive web application, where prospective students can use the model, is set to roll out next month!
