          <h2>About</h2>
          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m an aspiring tech entrepreneur, currently studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Although I’m currently studying in the United States, I hail from India and have lived in Dubai for most of my life. I received my IB Diploma at Dubai International Academy, where I was actively involved in Model UN as the Deputy Secretary General and was the President of a volunteering organization called DIA Cares. However, I’m most proud of founding Business Minds, an accelerator for student startups. At university, I’m part of a fraternity (Sigma Beta Rho) and am actively involved in the South Asian community. Over the past summer, I worked on my technical skills in a broad range of topics such as iOS App Development, Machine Learning and Web Development. I plan on leveraging these skills at <a href="https://productiv.com/"> Productiv</a>, a tech startup based in Silicon Valley, where I’ll be working as a Software Engineering Intern this upcoming summer! In my free time, I really enjoy adventure sports such as skydiving, bungee jumping and scuba-diving. A fun fact about me is that I skydived in Switzerland when I was just 9 years old! I’m hoping to pursue a skydiving license, so I can go on solo jumps!

              <p class="experience-box description-text"> I personally went through a body transformation, where I lost over 50 pounds. During my journey, I used pictures to track my progress. After researching different weight-tracking apps on the
                market, I found out that none of the currently-available weight management apps had a feature to store and compare transformation pictures. This motivated me to design Progressify, an iOS app that enables the user to track his fitness
                progress not only through his weight, but also through his transformation pictures. I used tools such as Sketch and InVision to design and prototype the app.

              <h4 class="space-giving"> Problem Statement </h4>
              <p class="experience-box description-text"> Fitness enthusiasts and gym-goers want a way to track their fitness progress through progress pictures so that
                they can see their progress more holistically.

                  <p> Final MockUp </p>
                </div>

                <p> My goal with the user interface/design of this app was to make it easy-to-use and minimalist. I achieved that using a simple color scheme and simplistic interface. That being said, my first mockup wasn’t like that. As seen above, I changed a few things in my final iteration after getting feedback from peers and instructors. I changed the color scheme to make it go from three colors to two colors, so that it was easier on the eyes. Moreover, I changed the background color to a lighter version of black than just plain black. One of my biggest changes, however, was redesigning the progress tab. As seen from the first mockup, the emphasis of the progress tab was the weight. However, since the progress entries are sorted by date rather than weight, I redesigned and changed the emphasis to date of entry. </p>
                
              </div>
              
              <a class="space-give" href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/J7ZMB4EP4CN#/439461822_ProblemStatement"> View Interactive Prototype </a>
              
              <h4 class="space-giving"> Rationale </h4>
              <img src="assets/img/Transformation_1.png" class="center2">
              <p class="space-give"> Transformation View </p>
              <p> After researching multiple leading weight-tracking apps available on the App Store, such as WeightFit, HappyScale, and MyWeight, it was clear that none of them had a feature where users can store and compare their transformation pictures. Thus, the proposed solution is most effective, as no other mobile apps solve the problem. Technically speaking, the transformation feature (as seen above), where users can compare their progress pictures, is the unique selling point (USP) of the app, and this feature is what puts the app in an uncompetitive market, or a blue ocean. Design decisions were centered around this feature of the app. For example, since viewing photos are a large part of the app, flashy colors and other visuals weren’t used; rather, a greyish black background was used to keep emphasis on the photos. Moreover, the features of the app were kept to a minimum on purpose to make the app simple and not overwhelming. Competing apps that were mentioned above also served as an influence for this app. Positives such as good information architecture of HappyScale was used while designing my own, whereas negatives such as bad onboarding processes in WeightFit and MyWeight were avoided and learnt from to ensure a smooth user experience. 

              </p>

              <h4 class="space-giving"> User Feedback </h4>
              <p> I decided to do some testing after my final prototype was ready, and I showed two of my friends the interactive prototype and let them play around with it. Both were avid gym-goers trying to get in shape, and they fit my target audience perfectly. Their initial impression was that they both really liked the app and saw the value that it created for them. They agreed with the problem that I was trying to solve, and said that they themselves would use the app. One of my friends pointed out that he would’ve liked to see a graph feature, where a user is able to see their progress visually through a graph. The other friend also agreed with him, and mentioned that the weight-tracking app he used before had that feature and he found it helpful.  </p>

              <h4 class="space-giving"> Next Steps </h4>
              <p> My next steps are to definitely implement the Graph feature that my friends talked about. Once I’m done with implementing that in an interactive prototype, I will actually start coding the app. Since it will be an iOS App, I will be using Swift programming language to do so. My timeline is that I will take about 3 months to have a beta-test ready, and once I get positive feedback on my beta-test and fix all the bugs I find, I will launch it to the App Store! </p>
